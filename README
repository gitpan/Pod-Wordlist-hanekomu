DESCRIPTION
    When loaded, this module automatically adds Test::Spelling stopwords for
    POD spell checking, that is, words that should be ignored by the spell
    check.

    The stopword list includes some CPAN author names, technical terms (e.g.
    JSON, URI) and other commonly-used words not included in the default
    word list (e.g. mixin, munging).
