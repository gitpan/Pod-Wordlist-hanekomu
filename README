NAME
    Pod::Wordlist::hanekomu - Add words for spell checking POD (DEPRECATED)

VERSION
    version 1.132680

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Spelling;
        use Pod::Wordlist::hanekomu;
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok('lib');

DESCRIPTION
    When loaded, this module automatically adds Test::Spelling stopwords for
    POD spell checking, that is, words that should be ignored by the spell
    check.

    The stopword list includes some CPAN author names, technical terms (e.g.
    JSON, URI) and other commonly-used words not included in the default
    word list (e.g. mixin, munging).

DEPRECATION
    All non-name words from this list have been merged into the master
    Pod::Wordlist module. Names are often grabbed directly from author and
    contributor metadata by relevant tools and are unlikely to be as
    necessary.

    Therefore, this list is no longer maintained.

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
    modules.
